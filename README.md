# Purdue Dining Food Reviews

## About the site
Have you ever wanted to try a certain food at the Purdue dining courts, but didn't know what the food looked like or what to expect? 
With our project, Purdue Dining Food Reviews, you can easily access what food items are avilable for the current day, see the most 
popular items on the menu as reviewed by others, and see a picture of the food before you go to eat it. You can even review the food 
items yourself on the site, adding to the ever growing list of reviews that can help boilermakers decide what to eat.
